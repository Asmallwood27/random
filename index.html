        <h1>What is Astrology ?</h1>
        <p>Well it's the language of stars. We have millions, billions and trillions of stars in the galaxy, so many we will probably never know the true count. With all things that are “discovered” it takes one or a few people to decide to give anything a deeper meaning. This is what the Babylonians did, although you may be more familiar with the Egyptians and Galileo when it comes to the history of stars.</p>

        <h2> How does this apply to me ? </h2>
        <p> Astrology can provide a wealth of knowledge into the most miniscule details of your life if you look hard enough. Have you ever wondered why Mercury Rx is a wild time for you ? Or why you have car wrecks almost every year ? Or just simply why you are the way you are ? Astrology can give insight on this and much more. CLick on your sign below to learn more. </p>
